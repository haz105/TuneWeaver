    "# TuneWeaver: Data Collection and Preparation for Playlist Recommendation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project:** TuneWeaver - Enhanced A/B/n Testing & Production-Ready Pipeline for Serendipity Playlists\n",
    "**Notebook Purpose:** This Jupyter Notebook handles the initial and crucial phase of the TuneWeaver project: **Data Collection and Preparation**. Its primary goal is to acquire a substantial dataset of music tracks from the Spotify API, including their metadata and audio features. Subsequently, it performs thorough pre-processing and cleaning to prepare this data for the downstream tasks of algorithm development, simulation, and A/B/n testing analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Activities in this Notebook:**\n",
    "1.  **Spotify API Interaction:** Utilizing the Spotipy library to connect to the Spotify Web API.\n",
    "2.  **Data Acquisition:** Fetching data for over 5,000 tracks across a diverse set of genres. This includes:\n",
    "    * Track metadata (ID, name, artist, album, popularity).\n",
    "    * Audio features (e.g., danceability, energy, valence, tempo).\n",
    "3.  **Initial Data Storage:** Saving the raw, collected data into a `songs.csv` file.\n",
    "4.  **Detailed Pre-processing:**\n",
    "    * Loading and inspecting the raw dataset.\n",
    "    * Comprehensive missing value analysis and imputation.\n",
    "    * Normalization of numerical features to ensure consistent scaling for subsequent analysis and modeling.\n",
    "5.  **Final Processed Data Storage:** Saving the cleaned and transformed dataset as `songs_processed.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outcome:** A well-structured, clean, and normalized dataset (`songs_processed.csv`) ready for the next stages of the TuneWeaver project, particularly for implementing and evaluating different playlist recommendation algorithms."
